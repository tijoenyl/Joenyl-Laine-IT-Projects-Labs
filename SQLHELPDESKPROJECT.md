This project is a "lainecorp.local" continuation of my first Active Directory Helpdesk project. In this project, I created a Help Desk ticketing system using MySQL Workbench on a VM. I curated this lab to demonstrate my foundational understanding of a Helpdesk/IT Support Specialist environment, as well as familiarity with SQL database query. The same users and departments I created for my Active Directory project will also be tied under this project as well.

As you can see, this ERR diagram shows the overall overview of this project and how each table is created.

These are the tables I created. EACH table is injected with columns and foregin keys in order for information to be received synergestically:
