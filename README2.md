This project is a continuation of my first Active Directory Helpdesk project. In this project, I created a Help Desk ticketing system using MySQL Workbench on a VM. I curated this lab to demonstrate my foundational understanding of a Helpdesk/IT Support Specialist environment, as well as familiarity with SQL database query. The same users and departments I created for my Active Directory project will also be tied under this project as well.
